# Generic-Login

If you're coming from my Android talk, this is not the code you're looking for.
You can grab it at darrienglasser.com/demologin.zip

A simple login screen written in Java. Set up as a template, so swap out the
logo with one of your own. Swap out the fields with what you do and don't want,
and Pre-configured with Retrofit. 

Should save time. Will eventually rewrite in Kotlin in the future.
